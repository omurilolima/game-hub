Game Hub is a frontend project using React + Typescript.
It's a mini version of the Rawg.io, a popular video game discovery platform.

## Key features:

- Dark and Light mode toggle
- Search bar
- Filter by genres and platforms
- Ordering the games and search results
- Loading skeletons
- Dinamic heading

## Design interface:

I used mostly Vanilla CSS + ChakraUI framework.
Was really fun to create 14 React components and deep dive in this aproach of coding.

## Data:

All the content was based on the Rawg API.
I developed 4 hooks using Axios for querying data from the API.

Deploy:
For hosting and deployment I used Vercel.

This project is part of the React 18 Course by [Code with Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/)
